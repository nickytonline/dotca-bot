# dotca-bot

The Twitch bot for [livecoding.ca](https://livecoding.ca)

Here are the commands you can use:

- `!crab`
- `!crate`
- `!todd`
- `!poop`
- `!donut`

All these Twitch commands create pieces on the stream that you can move around,
`!pieceName-direction`. To move them, for example for `!todd`, you would do
`!todd-left`, `!todd-right`, `!todd-up`, `!todd-down`.

You can also hide the Alpaca, using the `!alpaca-hide` command.

Have fun! Subscribers also get access to `!curl` and `!unicorn`.
